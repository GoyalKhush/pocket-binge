# Pocket Binge 💰

Pocket Binge is a MERN-based personal expense tracking web application built to manage and monitor daily expenditures.

This project focuses on implementing secure authentication, structured backend architecture, and real-world CRUD operations using MongoDB.


## 🚀 Tech Stack

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js (Vite)
- Node.js
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt (Password Hashing)
- Tailwind CSS
- Postman (API Testing)



## 🔐 Core Features

- User Registration & Login
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Protected routes
- Add, update, and delete daily expenses
- Categorize expenses
- RESTful APIs
- Modular backend structure with separate controllers


## 🛠 Backend Architecture

The backend is structured using:

- Controllers (authentication & expense logic separated)
- Routes
- Models
- Middleware for protected routes
- Environment variable configuration

All APIs were tested independently using Postman before frontend integration.
